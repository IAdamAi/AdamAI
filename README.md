    AdamAI is a chatbot to introduce people to Islam. Our main scope is to build a behavioral bot to encourage positive perceptions about Islam. People who'd like to get to know about Islam will be able to talk to Adam AI and have friendly conversations via bot speech and text.

## ðŸ‘‹ Intro
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/IAdamAi/AdamAI.svg?token=SzVqcxEhtJezzefm5yC1&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/IAdamAi/AdamAI)

This repository contains main backend of Adam AI. Currently it has a Python API which is deployed on Heroku. This API will be used as backend for all the social media faces of Adam AI. There is a telegram bot in other repository which uses this API to send responses. [telegram bot](https://github.com/IAdamAi/AdamAI_telegram) 

## Motivation

As you know machine learning has proven its importance in many fields, like computer vision, NLP, reinforcement learning, adversarial learning, etc .. Unfortunately, there are almost non-existent projects that utilizes ML and AI to support Islam and help spread the correct teachings. We wanted to present something that benefits from current technology to spread the beautiful and positive aspects of Islam. Islam is not only about religion or wrong and rights, Islam is a humble lifestyle and when understood correctly itâ€™s a meaningful teacher for humankind and the planet as a whole. 

## Goal 

To build an intelligent conversational chatbot that communicates naturally with its users to introduce islam and its different aspects with a friendly tone. 

## Challenges

Islamâ€™s wide variety of topics and categories are open domain and unlimited in scope. As well as the approach of cultures differ and so the challenge raises because of the huge variety. It is not a mere service or a single topic to assign. Another challenge is the different ways people perceive spiritual or deep conversations. For example a person who is interested to learn about Islam in the in the Philippines is different from another in Nigeria, and different from Mosco or New York, for this we need to develop an algorithm with convergence and understanding of the local culture of the speaking person.

## Procedure 

Our procedure is generalized and can be generalized to many dataset act models not only our input . This standrized approach takes part as multiple steps starting from training on cloud using Rasa open- source ML then porting the models to the other channels.

## Models

we use Rasa X Open-source

## ðŸ”§ Getting started
To start developing, You should setup this project locally. We require this to avoid submitting untested code. Soon we will have our staging server as well so it will add one more layer of testing.


## ðŸ”¨ Contributing
If you want to start contributing to any of the Adam AI projects, please create an issue explainig. In the meantime, feel free to pick up any of the open issues and assign it to yourself or create a PR for any bugs you encounter.

To create a PR, branch off `master` and include your name and the feature name following this pattern: `yourname/feature_name`

## ðŸŽ¯ Target & Future Roadmap:

We are hoping AdamAI to be fully equiped with following feature in future: 

* Both text and voice connversation.
* Natural Language Processing (NLP)
* Machine Learning (ML)
* Question focused 
* Realtime conversation 
* User friendly
* Able to answer off-topic questions smartly
