    AdamAI is a chatbot to introduce people to Islam. Our main motive is to make this a software preacher to preach Islam. People who'd like to get information about Islam will be able to talk to Adam AI to receive different teachings via bot speech and text.

## ðŸ‘‹ Intro
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/IAdamAi/AdamAI.svg?token=SzVqcxEhtJezzefm5yC1&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/IAdamAi/AdamAI)

This repository contains main backend of Adam AI. Currently it has a Nodejs API which is deployed on Heroku. This API will be used as backend for all the social media faces of Adam AI. There is a [telegram bot](https://github.com/IAdamAi/AdamAI_telegram) in other repository which uses this API to send responses.

## Motivation

As you know machine learning has proven its importance in many fields, like computer vision, NLP, reinforcement learning, adversarial learning, etc .. Unfortunately, there is a little work to make machine learning accessible for support the Dawah and muslims community tools and services.

## Goal 

To build a smart chatbot textural that expert communicate to introduce islam, and all topics about islam with friendly and passion language speak English.

## Challenges

Issues of Islam topics are open domain and unlimited in scope. The expressive cultures differ from the spirit of Islam and the challenges of those who want to convert to Islam in the Philippines are different from Nigeria and also different from other cultures and ideas in London or New York, for this we need to develop an algorithm with convergence and understanding of the local culture of the speaking person.

## Procedure 

Our procedure is generalized and can be generalized to many dataset act models not only our input . This standrized approach takes part as multiple steps starting from training on cloud using Rasa open- source ML then porting the models to the other channels.

## Models

we use Rasa X Open-source
